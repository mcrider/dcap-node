DCAP allows you to easily create and manage well-structured documents that are stored on IPFS. A simple user account system tied to a PGP keypair allows you to encrypt and decrypt your documents over an easy-to-use REST API.

With DCAP you can create document types for things such as notes, todos, chat messages, web page data, social network updates and more. These documents will be stored on the decentralized IPFS network and pinned by the API to ensure accessibility. You can choose to store your documents in plaintext for all to see or encrypt them for privacy. DCAP's API makes it easier to create and retrieve these decentralized documents in your website and apps.

## Setup
### Requirements
- Node.js
- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

### Installation
Clone this repository and run `npm install`. Copy the sample configuration file (`.env.example`) to `.env` and edit it to match your desired configuration. Run `npm start` to start DCAP on `http://localhost:5000`. Please use this with SSL on production environments.

### Configuration
The main configuration is loaded from `.env`. You can change the security behavior and whether DCAP should pin IPFS documents from these settings.

In the `/src/config/types` directory are the type definitions that DCAP uses to validate the content you post. These must be written in [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org) to be validated by DCAP. You can use the example types that come bundled with DCAP but will probably want to add some more attributes to make them useful.

**Example type configuration**
```
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-06/schema#",
  "title": "note", // Type name as referenced in API requests
  "description": "Simple note content type",
  "type": "object",
  "encrypted": true, // Set to false to make document publicly readable
  "properties": {
    "text": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [ // Required field names
    "text"
  ]
}
```
